When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - When working with a team, or when I would like my software to be available publicly
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - Because the local repository might have changes that the remote doesn't, and automatic pull might break the current software.
