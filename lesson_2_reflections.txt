What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 - You make it a git-usable folder. To use the version control functionality.
 
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 - It's a place where a commit can be prepared, actions applied to there do not affect files neither in working directory or repository (it is like a buffer)
 - Helps organize what has to be commited.
 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 - Just add the file(s) with git add, then commit them with git commit
